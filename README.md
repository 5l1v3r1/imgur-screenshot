```bash
imgur_key="486690f872c678126a2c09a9e196ce1b"
imgur_icon_path="$HOME/Pictures/imgur.png"
save_file="true"
file_prefix="imgur-"
file_dir="$HOME/Pictures"
edit_command="gimp %img"
upload_connect_timeout="5"
upload_timeout="120"
upload_retries="1"
copy_url="true"
open_command="firefox %url"
log_file="$HOME/.imgur-screenshot.log"
check_update="true"
```

Note
----

The screenshot will be taken **after** the selection has been made. This could be annoying if you want to capture something quickly and _then_ want to select an area. I might implement this as a FutureFeatureâ„¢ when I find a decent way to display an image in full screen.

Troubleshooting
----

If you get a notification like

> **Something went wrong :(<br>**
> Information logged to /foo/bar/logfile.log

This probably means that `scrot -s`/`screencapture -s` was unable to make a selective screenshot.

* You pressed the <kbd>any</kbd> key during selection
* (Linux) `sleep 0.1` in the script didn't help. Try increasing the value
* You don't have permission to write the file
* One of the dependencies is not installed
* You don't have your display plugged in (remote?) >_<
* ?? - run `scrot -s`/`screencapture -s` directly and check the outcome
