## Please update your git remote path!
I have recently **changed my username from _JonApps_ to _jomo_**, please make sure to update your git remotes!
If you see a notification that looks like this, you still have the old version:

> **Update found**<br>
> Version \<html\>\<body\>You are being \<a href="http<br>
> s://raw.github.com/jomo/imgur-screenshot/"\>redi<br>
> rected\</a\>.\</body\>\</htm\l>

Just run these commands:
* SSH: `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jomo/imgur-screenshot.git`
* HTTPS: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jomo/imgur-screenshot.git`

Features
----
* You can edit the screenshot with any program _(GUI or CLI)_ before uploading
* The link can be copied to clipboard
* Normal image files can be uploaded, too
* Upload anonymous or to your imgur account
* You can open the URL or file with any program _(browser, image viewer)_ after upload
* The screenshot can be saved or deleted from disk
* All filenames + URLs (and errors) are logged
* The program can check for updates

The edit feature is very interesting for automization with something like [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php), or to add notes with a GUI editor.

Installation
----

Check if you have all dependencies installed:

```Bash
imgur-screenshot --check
```

That's it. You can bind the script to a hotkey or add it (or a symlink) to your $PATH for quick access ;)

**Enjoy!**

Usage
----
```bash
imgur-screenshot [[--connect | --check | -v ] | [-e | --edit=true|false] [-l | --login=true|false] [file]]
```

* `--connect` Connect to your imgur account, exit
* `--check` Check if all dependencies are installed, exit
* `-v` Print current version, exit
* `--edit=true|false` override _edit_ config (_-e_ is _--edit=true_)
* `--login=true|false` override _login_ config (_-l_ is _--login=true_)
* `file` instead of uploading a screenshot, upload `file`

### Uploading a screenshot

All you need to do is simply run `imgur-screenshot`.

### Uploading a screenshot to your account

```bash
imgur-screenshot --connect # shows you which account you're connected to
imgur-screenshot -l
```

Note
----

The screenshot will be taken **after** the selection has been made. This could be annoying if you want to capture something quickly and _then_ want to select an area. I might implement this as a FutureFeatureâ„¢ when I find a decent way to capture the whole screen, display the shot in full screen and then crop it to a selection.

Troubleshooting
----

If you get a notification like

> **Something went wrong :(<br>**
> Information logged to /foo/bar/logfile.log

This probably means that `scrot -s`/`screencapture -s` was unable to make a selective screenshot.

* You pressed the <kbd>any</kbd> key during selection
* (Linux) `sleep 0.1` in the script didn't help. Try increasing the value
* You don't have permission to write the file
* One of the dependencies is not installed
* You don't have your display plugged in (wrong terminal?) >_<
* ?? - run `scrot -s`/`screencapture -s` directly and check the outcome
