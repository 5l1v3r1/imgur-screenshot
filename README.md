# Imgur-Screenshot

A bash script for Linux that lets you take a screenshot, select an area, (edit it), upload it to [imgur](https://imgur.com), copies the link to clipboard (and opens the link).

Move the script to somewhere in your `PATH` as `imgur-screenshot`. Create a keyboard shortcut for <kbd>Print</kbd> (or any key you like) and set it to `imgur-screenshot`.

**Enjoy!**
